I am a software and data engineering expert with over 10 years of experience turning raw, messy information into actionable insights. My passion lies in architecting end-to-end systems that bridge the gap between physical hardware signals and high-level business intelligence.

Currently, I serve as a Software Engineer supporting NOAA Fisheries, where I develop full-stack solutions for scientific data collection at sea. My work involves building cross-platform desktop (Python/Qt) and web (TypeScript/React) applications, automating complex NMEA sensor pipelines on AWS, and re-designing large-scale PostgreSQL databases for performance and spatial analytics with PostGIS.

While my roots are in Earth Sciences and GIS, I am driven by the technical challenge of building resilient infrastructure for any domain. Whether managing sensitive healthcare data or spearheading AI/ML image collection projects in the field, my focus is always on delivering reliable, scalable data products.
